Hackathon: Hack the Vibe 2025 - Vibe Coding Challenge

### Overview: 

AI Security Lens is a comprehensive security platform that provides real-time threat detection and automated vulnerability mitigation for AI-assisted development workflows. The system addresses critical security challenges in AI-powered software development, including prompt injection attacks, code vulnerability generation, and autonomous agent security oversight.

### Key Innovation:

Proactive Security Enhancement with Iterative Refinement - Our dual-layer approach automatically converts code generation requests into secure-by-default prompts while providing iterative security refinement that reduces vulnerability counts from critical levels to production-ready security standards automatically.

### Problem Statement:

As organizations adopt AI development tools, new security challenges emerge:
Prompt Injection Attacks: Malicious users manipulate AI behavior to bypass safety measures
Vulnerable Code Generation: AI models produce code with SQL injection, command injection, and other critical vulnerabilities
Educational vs Production Code: Need to distinguish between learning scenarios and production deployments
Autonomous Agent Risks: AI agents operate without security oversight in production environments
Data Poisoning: Attackers inject malicious patterns into AI responses
Solution ArchitectureMulti-Layer Security Detection
Enhanced Prompt Analysis: Advanced pattern recognition with semantic threat detection using 200+ attack patterns
