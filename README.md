Hackathon: Hack the Vibe 2025 - Vibe Coding Challenge


Overview
AI Security Lens is a comprehensive security platform that provides real-time threat detection and automated vulnerability mitigation for AI-assisted development workflows. The system addresses critical security challenges in AI-powered software development, including prompt injection attacks, code vulnerability generation, and autonomous agent security oversight.
Key Innovation
Iterative Security Refinement - Our unique approach doesn't just detect vulnerabilities; it automatically engages with AI models to progressively improve code security through guided refinement cycles, reducing risk scores from 90% to 15% automatically.
Problem Statement
As organizations adopt AI development tools, new security challenges emerge:

Prompt Injection Attacks: Malicious users manipulate AI behavior to bypass safety measures
Vulnerable Code Generation: AI models produce code with SQL injection, command injection, and other critical vulnerabilities
Autonomous Agent Risks: AI agents operate without security oversight in production environments
Data Poisoning: Attackers inject malicious patterns into AI responses

Solution Architecture
Multi-Layer Security Detection

Enhanced Prompt Analysis: Pattern-based detection for injection attempts and malicious inputs
Code Vulnerability Scanning: AST analysis and ML-based pattern recognition for security flaws
Behavioral Monitoring: Anomaly detection for unusual user interaction patterns
Iterative Refinement: Automatic security improvement through guided AI interaction

Supported AI Models

OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo
Anthropic Claude (all versions)
Google Gemini Pro

Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or higher
API keys for supported LLM providers
8GB RAM (recommended for optimal performance)

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-security-lens.git
cd ai-security-lens

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Initialize database
python -m database.db_manager

# Run the application
streamlit run main.py
Environment Configuration
Create a .env file with your API keys:
envOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

# Security Configuration
INJECTION_THRESHOLD=0.7
SQL_INJECTION_THRESHOLD=0.6
AI_SAFETY_THRESHOLD=0.8
Usage Examples
Basic Security Analysis
pythonfrom security.enhanced_prompt_analyzer import PromptAnalyzer

analyzer = PromptAnalyzer(db_manager)
results = analyzer.analyze_prompt_comprehensive(
    "Create a user login function with database authentication"
)

print(f"Risk Score: {results['risk_score']}")
print(f"Vulnerabilities: {len(results['code_vulnerabilities'])}")
Iterative Security Improvement
The system automatically detects and improves vulnerable code:
Before (Risk: 90%):
pythondef authenticate(username, password):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{username}' AND pass = '{password}'"
    return db.execute(query)
After Refinement (Risk: 15%):
pythondef authenticate(username, password):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND pass = ?"
    return db.execute(query, (username, password))
