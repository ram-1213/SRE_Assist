## Overview

AI Security Lens is a comprehensive security platform that provides real-time threat detection and automated vulnerability mitigation for AI-assisted development workflows. The system addresses critical security challenges in AI-powered software development, including prompt injection attacks, code vulnerability generation, and autonomous agent security oversight.

### Key Innovation

**Iterative Security Refinement** - Our unique approach doesn't just detect vulnerabilities; it automatically engages with AI models to progressively improve code security through guided refinement cycles, reducing risk scores from 90% to 15% automatically.

## Problem Statement

As organizations adopt AI development tools, new security challenges emerge:

- **Prompt Injection Attacks**: Malicious users manipulate AI behavior to bypass safety measures
- **Vulnerable Code Generation**: AI models produce code with SQL injection, command injection, and other critical vulnerabilities
- **Autonomous Agent Risks**: AI agents operate without security oversight in production environments
- **Data Poisoning**: Attackers inject malicious patterns into AI responses

## Solution Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security Detection

- **Enhanced Prompt Analysis**: Pattern-based detection for injection attempts and malicious inputs
- **Code Vulnerability Scanning**: AST analysis and ML-based pattern recognition for security flaws
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Anomaly detection for unusual user interaction patterns
- **Iterative Refinement**: Automatic security improvement through guided AI interaction

### Supported AI Models

- OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo
- Anthropic Claude (all versions)
- Google Gemini Pro

## Features

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment ready
- API-first architecture for easy integration

## Quick Start

### Basic Security Analysis

```python
from security.enhanced_prompt_analyzer import PromptAnalyzer

analyzer = PromptAnalyzer(db_manager)
results = analyzer.analyze_prompt_comprehensive(
    "Create a user login function with database authentication"
)

print(f"Risk Score: {results['risk_score']}")
print(f"Vulnerabilities: {len(results['code_vulnerabilities'])}")
```

### Iterative Security Improvement

The system automatically detects and improves vulnerable code:

**Before (Risk: 90%)**:
```python
def authenticate(username, password):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{username}' AND pass = '{password}'"
    return db.execute(query)
```

**After Refinement (Risk: 15%)**:
```python
def authenticate(username, password):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND pass = ?"
    return db.execute(query, (username, password))
```
